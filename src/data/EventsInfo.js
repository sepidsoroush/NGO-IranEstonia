These arrests are often companies by verbal and physical violence.

According to reports at least 1500 people were killed by government forces during 3 days, during which internet access was completely shut down by the Iranian government, and massacred its own people when they were disconnected from the outside world. Thru the current protests happening for 2 months, the Islamic republic’s government imposed the death sentence on thousands of detained protesters. We gathered in Tallinn, Vabaduse väljak (Freedom square), to remember the victims of November 2019 and warn the international community of the history repeating, the protesters getting executed however this time we will say their names and ask the free world to make the Islamic regime accountable. We commemorate Khodanur Lojei, who was killed during the 2022 Zahedan massacre. He was tied to a flagpole after getting shot in his kidney, and he was tortured by thirst.",

The Iranian people began their revolution against the dictatorship regime after Mahsa Amini, 22, was brutally killed by the Morality Police. Since the very beginning of the revolution, university, high school, and even elementary school students have been a big part of it. The regime launched a series of vicious attacks on universities and schools and many students have been killed, kidnapped, disappeared, or detained. Many of the detainees are students and scholars like us, who simply wish to restore basic human rights in Iran and now face the death penalty in prisons. We see it as our responsibility to be the voice of our people. Campus rallies are organized on November 30th in more than 100 universities around the globe to stand with liberal people for Iran, especially scholars. As part of global coordination, we gathered in front of the main building of the University of Tartu and rallied peacefully to Delta center and back. We were joined by many international students and chanted for Women, life, freedom. ",

    content :"From the beginning of the revolution in Iran, at least 18000 people have been detained and sent to prisons. These protesters are tortured, denied necessary medical needs, assaulted, and violated physically and mentally. Many of them are facing the immediate risk of execution. They are denied their basic rights and cannot obtain their chosen lawyers and are sentenced in shame trials, some lasting only for 15 minutes. Mohsen Shekari, 23 years old, was the first person who was executed on 8th of December 22 in public for involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, accused of blocking the street. Majidreza Rahnavard, 23 years old, was wrongfully accused of stabbing two militia guards and executed by hanging on December 12th, 2022. We silently marched towards the Estonian parliament building and gathered there in solidarity with innocent victims of executions and people who are facing these unjust sentences only for asking for freedom. We asked the international community to make the Islamic regime accountable and stand with the people of Iran.",

It was in the midst of conflicts with the USA and the IRCG alleged that they mistook the plane for a Cruise missile over Tehran. We commemorated Flight PS752 on the 7th of January 2023, its 3rd anniversary, which also marks the 110th day of the ongoing Iranian revolution. We organized a memorial at the University of Tartu, to show solidarity with the people of Iran and remember those whose lives were cut short by the Islamic dictatorship.

Some of the artists whose works are on display include Gianluca Costantini, Marco Melgrati, Maryam Salimian, Farzaneh, and Mahdi Ghazi. The matter of women, life, and freedom is a critical issue that has been at the forefront of social and political discourse in Iran. Women in Iran continue to face various forms of discrimination, violence, and oppression. The gallery sheds light on the efforts of the women's movement to challenge the status quo and promote a more inclusive and equitable society that values women's rights and freedoms. It is worth noting that the artists inside Iran remain anonymous due to concerns for their security. Despite the challenges, they continue to use their creativity and artistry to make their voices heard and contribute to the ongoing struggle for women's rights and freedom in Iran. The gallery celebrates the power of art as a tool for social change and encourages viewers to reflect on their role in the fight for gender equality and justice.",

    content :"On this International Women's Day, Mondo invites you to discuss the situation in Iran today, where people are fighting for women's rights. The biggest protests against the Islamic Republic's dictatorship in Iran in recent decades are about women's rights and freedoms. The protests began in September 2022 after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amin. The woman did not wear the hijab in accordance with government standards, was arrested, beaten, and died two days later of internal bleeding. The protests spread across the country and turned into a nationwide movement against the regime of the Islamic Republic. Many people were killed or arrested in unarmed protests. The protests in Iran continue. We will focus on the situation in the country today, but also look back at what preceded the protests. We will discuss how the message Zan, Zendegi, Azadi - Women, Life, Freedom has spread around the world, being more universal than one might think. The panelists are: Kristi Ockba, Mondo's expert on Middle East Susanna Veevo, author of “My Iran. Stolen freedom” Maliheh Keshmiri, Iranian Supportive Organization in Estonia. The event is in English and will take place at the Mondo in Telliskivi Creative City, Tallinn. You are also welcome to visit the photo exhibition Women, Life, Freedom in Telliskivi Creative City at Kolme Puu Galerii. This Mondo Academy event is held in cooperation with Mondo, Iranian Supportive Organization in Estonia and Telliskivi Creative Campus.",

    content :'It has been more than 5 months since the start of the 2022 revolution of the people of Iran. After the brutal death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini by the hands of the Islamic Republic’s “Morality Police”; Iranian people started their revolution against the dictatorship regime. Since the very beginning of the revolution, university, high-school and even elementary school students have been a big part of it. The regime launched a series of brutal attacks in the universities and schools which is against their own law! Many students have been killed, kidnapped, or disappeared. On average, the Islamic republic forces have killed one child (under the age of 18) per day since the start of the revolution. This bloodshed has not been enough for the Islamic Republic and now they executed some of the protesters who have been captured, and they are planning to execute more people! Many of those are students and scholars like us, who simply wish to restore the basic human rights in Iran. We see it as our responsibility to be the voice of our people. Therefore, we invite you to join us and help us in our mission in a globally coordinated Campus Rally for Iranian women on 8th of March from 12:00 to 13:00 in front of the main building of the University of Tartu (Ülikooli 18). We will have a peaceful walk through Raekoja plats- Rüütli street- Lai street to the Delta center and then back to the Raekoja plats through the central park. We especially invite our Ukrainian sisters and brothers to join us in this rally as we are “fighting the same fight”.',
