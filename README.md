# ðŸ“£ **Summary**

This website [Iranian Supportive Organization](https://iraniansupportive.org/) was built using React Hooks, React-Router-Dom, Formik, Yup, React-Helmet, Dynamic Routes, React-icons, Firebase, Axios, and more! Also I used **Tailwind CSS** for this project and I really enjoyed using it.
